But they do get grouchy in middle age. The beloved King Ik is dead, and there was barely time to check his pulse before the royal throne was supporting the suspiciously shapely backside of an impostor pretending to be Ik\'s beautiful, long-lost daughter. With the land\'s heroic hunks busy drooling all over themselves, there\'s only one man left who can save the kingdom of Jenair. His name is Dungar Loloth, a rural blacksmith turned innkeeper, a surly hermit, and an all-around nobody oozing toward middle age, compensating for a lack of height, looks, charm, and tact with guts and an attitude. Normally politics is the least of his concerns, but after everyone in the neighboring kingdom of Farrawee comes down with a severe case of being dead, Dungar learns that the masquerading princess not only is behind the carnage but also has similar plans for his own hometown. Together with the only person senseless enough to tag along, an eccentric and arguably insane hobo named Jimminy, he journeys out into the world he\'s so pointedly tried to avoid as the only hope of defeating the most powerful person in it.

With that realization everyone freaked out for a little while. </p> <p>Or almost everyone. The residents of Sorrow Falls took the news pretty well. This could have been due to a certain local quality of unflappability, or it could have been that in three years the ship did exactly nothing other than sit quietly in that field, and nobody understood the full extent of this nothing the ship was doing better than the people who lived right next door. </p> <p>Sixteen-year-old Annie Collins is one of the ship\'s closest neighbors. Once upon a time she took every last theory about the ship seriously, whether it was advanced by an adult or by a peer. Surely one of the theories would be proven true - if not several of them - the very minute the ship decided to do something. Annie is starting to think this will never happen. </p> <p>One late August morning, a little over three years since the ship landed, Edgar Somerville arrived in town. Ed\'s a government operative posing as a journalist, which is obvious to Annie - and pretty much everyone else he meets - almost immediately. He has a lot of questions that need answers, because he thinks everyone is wrong: The ship <i>is</i> doing something, and he needs Annie\'s help to figure out what that is. </p> <p>Annie is a good choice for tour guide. She already knows everyone in town, and when Ed\'s theory is proven correct - something is apocalyptically wrong in Sorrow Falls - she\'s a pretty good person to have around. </p> <p>As a matter of fact, Annie Collins might be the most important person on the planet.

The medical staff seems friendly enough, but something feels...off. As the days pass, Ethan’s investigation into the disappearance of his colleagues turns up more questions than answers.

But any adult knows that our work anxieties and shameful memories would rather stay up all night and chat. That’s where Offerman and Co. come in—with clever and occasionally downright dark parodies of the classic kids genre. What really happened after Snow White died, from the perspective of the one medically trained dwarf? A naive wizard professor reports back from the trenches of an underprivileged school of magic. A middle-aged man is haunted by the voices of his own aging body.

The first complication is an unmistakable sign of sinister agendas afoot: a squirrel atop the train. But an even more ominous situation is in store when the trio plus Atticus stumble across a murder upon arrival at the station. They recognize Detective Gabriela Ibarra, who\'s there to investigate. But they also recognize the body - or rather that the body is a doppelganger for Atticus himself. </p> <p>The police, hampered by human senses of smell and a decided lack of canine intuition, obviously can\'t handle this alone. Not with Atticus likely in danger. Oberon knows it\'s time to investigate once more - for justice! For gravy!

Always more squirrels! </p> <p>But will our hungry band of heroes be able to identify the culprit before someone else is murdered?

Most genetic defects will be removed at birth; the remaining during infancy. Unfortunately, there will be a generation left behind. For members of that missed generation, small advances will be made. Through various programs, they will be taught to get along in the world despite their differences. They will be made active and contributing members of society. But they will never be normal. <p> Lou Arrendale is a member of that lost generation, born at the wrong time to reap the awards of medical science. Part of a small group of high-functioning autistic adults, he has a steady job with a pharmaceutical company, a car, friends, and a passion for fencing. Aside from his annual visits to his counselor, he lives a low-key, independent life. He has learned to shake hands and make eye contact. He has taught himself to use \\"please\\" and \\"thank you\\" and other conventions of conversation because he knows it makes others comfortable. He does his best to be as normal as possible and not to draw attention to himself.But then his quiet life comes under attack.</p> <p> It starts with an experimental treatment that will reverse the effects of autism in adults. With this treatment Lou would think and act and be just like everyone else. But if he was suddenly free of autism, would he still be himself? Would he still love the same classical music - with its complications and resolutions? Would he still see the same colors and patterns in the world - shades and hues that others cannot see? Most importantly, would he still love Marjory, a woman who may never be able to reciprocate his feelings? Would it be easier for her to return the love of a \\"normal\\"? </p> <p> There are intense pressures coming from the world around him - including an angry supervisor who wants to cut costs by sacrificing the supports necessary to employ autistic workers. Perhaps even more disturbing are the barrage of questions within himself.

It\'s perfectly safe</b>. </p> <p>The folks in Mike Erikson\'s small New England town would say he\'s just your average, everyday guy. And that\'s exactly how Mike likes it. Sure, the life he\'s chosen isn\'t much of a challenge to someone with his unique gifts, but he\'s content with his quiet and peaceful existence. That is until an old friend presents him with an irresistible mystery, one that Mike is uniquely qualified to solve. </p> <p>Far out in the California desert, a team of DARPA scientists has invented a device they affectionately call the Albuquerque Door. Using a cryptic computer equation and magnetic fields to \\"fold\\" dimensions, it shrinks distances so a traveler can travel hundreds of feet with a single step. The invention promises to make mankind\'s dreams of teleportation a reality. And, the scientists insist, traveling through the door is completely safe. Yet evidence is mounting that this miraculous machine isn\'t quite what it seems - and that its creators are harboring a dangerous secret. </p> <p>As his investigations draw him deeper into the puzzle, Mike begins to fear there\'s only one answer that makes sense. And if he\'s right, it may be only a matter of time before the project destroys...everything. A cunningly inventive mystery featuring a hero worthy of Sherlock Holmes and a terrifying final twist you\'ll never see coming, <i>The Fold</i> is that rarest of things: a genuine pause-resister science-fiction thriller.

After centuries, Viking vampire Leif Helgarson is ready to get his vengeance, and he\'s asked his friend Atticus O\'Sullivan, the last of the Druids, to help take down this Norse nightmare. One survival strategy has worked for Atticus for more than two thousand years: stay away from the guy with the lightning bolts. But things are heating up in Atticus\'s home base of Tempe, Arizona. There\'s a vampire turf war brewing, and Russian demon hunters who call themselves the Hammers of God are running rampant. Despite multiple warnings and portents of dire consequences, Atticus and Leif journey to the Norse plain of Asgard, where they team up with a werewolf, a sorcerer, and an army of frost giants for an epic showdown against vicious Valkyries, angry gods, and the hammer-wielding Thunder Thug himself. </p> <p>This is book three of the <i>Iron Druid Chronicles</i> series.

How else to explain the dreams he keeps having - dreams that mirror, with impossible accuracy, the gruesome serial murders taking place all over San Francisco? How else to explain the <i>feelings </i>these dreams provoke in him - not disgust, not horror, but <i>excitement?</i> </p> <p>As Bryan and his longtime partner, Lawrence \'Pookie\' Chang, investigate the murders, they learn that things are even stranger than they at first seem. For the victims are all enemies of a seemingly ordinary young boy - a boy who is gripped by the same dreams that haunt Bryan. Meanwhile, a shadowy vigilante, seemingly armed with superhuman powers, is out there killing the killers. And Bryan and Pookie\'s superiors - from the mayor on down - seem strangely eager to keep the detectives from discovering the truth. </p> <p>Doubting his own sanity and stripped of his badge, Bryan begins to suspect that he\'s stumbled into the crosshairs of a shadow war that has gripped his city for more than a century - a war waged by a race of killers living in San Francisco\'s unknown, underground ruins, emerging at night to feed on those who will not be missed. </p> <p>And as Bryan learns the truth about his own intimate connections to the killings, he discovers that those who matter most to him are in mortal danger…and that he may be the only man gifted - or cursed - with the power to do battle with the <i>nocturnals</i>. </p> <p> Featuring a dazzlingly plotted mystery and a terrifying descent into a nightmarish underworld - long with some of the most incredible action scenes ever put to paper, and an explosive, gut-wrenching conclusion you won\'t soon forget, <i>Nocturnal</i> is the most spectacular outing to date from one of the genre\'s brightest stars. </p>","tags":[{"name":"Horror","url":"18574490011"},{"name":"Crime Fiction","url":"18574598011"},{"name":"Crime Thrillers","url":"18574623011"},{"name":"Supernatural","url":"18574638011"},{"name":"Suspense","url":"18574639011"}],"title":"Nocturnal: A Novel","titleShort":"Nocturnal: A Novel","whispersync":"available"},{"added":21,"asin":"B07B3P4RY7","authors":[{"name":"Barry J.

He makes an excellent guide through history, when he\'s sober. </p>","tags":[{"name":"Contemporary","url":"18580623011"},{"name":"Adventure","url":"18580629011"}],"title":"Immortal: The Immortal Series, Book 1","titleShort":"Immortal","whispersync":"available"},{"added":5,"asin":"B0711L56NR","authors":[{"name":"Leonard Goldberg","url":"B001JXCXDY"}],"blurb":"Joanna Blalock\'s keen mind and incredible insight lead her to become a highly skilled nurse, one of the few professions that allow her to use her finely tuned brain....","categories":[{"name":"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","url":"18574597011"},{"name":"Mystery","url":"18574606011"}],"cover":"51I8xisuTvL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","isbns":[{"identifier":"9781250101051","type":"ISBN_13"},{"identifier":"1250101050","type":"ISBN_10"}],"language":"English","length":"9h 36m ","narrators":[{"name":"Steve West"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B07DLDWMGG","authors":"Leonard Goldberg","cover":"51ELJj49J5L","length":"8 hrs and 40 mins","narrators":"Steve West","subHeading":"A Daughter of Sherlock Holmes Mystery, Book 2","title":"A Study in Treason"},{"asin":"1250223970","authors":"Leonard Goldberg","cover":"51z5pgoDl6L","length":"8 hrs and 47 mins","narrators":"Steve West","subHeading":"A Daughter of Sherlock Holmes Mystery, Book 3","title":"The Disappearance of Alistair Ainsworth"},{"asin":"1250751756","authors":"Leonard Goldberg","cover":"51ysyp+Y2kL","length":"9 hrs and 27 mins","narrators":"Steve West","subHeading":"A Daughter of Sherlock Holmes Mystery","title":"The Art of Deception"},{"asin":"1250804833","authors":"Leonard Goldberg","cover":"51J6mUN6LiS","length":"10 hrs and 41 mins","narrators":"Steve West","subHeading":"A Daughter of Sherlock Holmes Mystery, Book 5","title":"The Abduction of Pretty Penny"},{"asin":"059329209X","authors":"Sherry Thomas","cover":"51fBzkWz7yL","length":"13 hrs and 15 mins","narrators":"Kate Reading","subHeading":"The Lady Sherlock Series, Book 5","title":"Murder on Cold Street"},{"asin":"B098XY25RQ","authors":"Jana DeLeon","cover":"61mtDWUjEvS","length":"8 hrs and 26 mins","narrators":"Cassandra Campbell","subHeading":"Miss Fortune Mysteries, Book 20","title":"Frightfully Fortune"},{"asin":"B003VW6KU8","authors":"Rhys Bowen","cover":"513G4K4atYL","length":"8 hrs and 4 mins","narrators":"Katherine Kellgren","title":"Her Royal Spyness"},{"asin":"0593151550","authors":"Sherry Thomas","cover":"51K5u0oXqxL","length":"10 hrs and 17 mins","narrators":"Kate Reading","subHeading":"The Lady Sherlock Series, Book 4","title":"The Art of Theft"},{"asin":"B01N8ZU8KV","authors":"Rhys Bowen","cover":"51hvar2DMtL","length":"6 hrs and 30 mins","narrators":"Roger Clark","title":"Evans Above"},{"asin":"B003Y7P9W0","authors":"Rhys Bowen","cover":"51gI3gjbYsL","length":"8 hrs and 57 mins","narrators":"Katherine Kellgren","title":"A Royal Pain"},{"asin":"B01N0BO0QZ","authors":"Will Thomas","cover":"61SpfLBAh9L","length":"9 hrs and 28 mins","narrators":"Antony Ferguson","subHeading":"Barker & Llewelyn Series, Book 1","title":"Some Danger Involved"},{"asin":"B004FKK7WM","authors":"Rhys Bowen","cover":"512+FwIr1iL","length":"9 hrs and 20 mins","narrators":"Katherine Kellgren","title":"Royal Blood"},{"asin":"B005KMCA9W","authors":"Rhys Bowen","cover":"51pxgSe0y3L","length":"9 hrs and 34 mins","narrators":"Katherine Kellgren","title":"Naughty in Nice"},{"asin":"B00A9VCE4U","authors":"Rhys Bowen","cover":"517uoFoGhcL","length":"9 hrs and 25 mins","narrators":"Katherine Kellgren","title":"The Twelve Clues of Christmas"},{"asin":"B00O7ZAM8Y","authors":"Rhys Bowen","cover":"51EMxtmUYvL","length":"1 hr and 44 mins","narrators":"Katherine Kellgren","subHeading":"A Royal Spyness Novella","title":"Masked Ball at Broxley Manor"},{"asin":"B076JJLJMS","authors":"Ellery Adams","cover":"61E+UtcLZ8L","length":"8 hrs and 31 mins","narrators":"Cris Dukehart","title":"The Secret, Book & Scone Society"},{"asin":"0593456963","authors":"Sherry Thomas","cover":"518I5nHq7bS","length":"Unabridged","narrators":"13 hrs","subHeading":"The Lady Sherlock Series, Book 6","title":"Miss Moriarty, I Presume?"},{"asin":"B002V5CSM0","authors":"Alan Bradley","cover":"512wl+DwuWL","length":"9 hrs and 53 mins","narrators":"Jayne Entwistle","subHeading":"A Flavia de Luce Mystery","title":"The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie"}],"progress":"Finished","publishers":[{"name":"Macmillan Audio"}],"rating":4.3,"ratings":2648,"releaseDate":"2017-06-06","sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/aren/002543/bk_aren_002543_sample.mp3","series":[{"asin":"B07DM69XQY","bookNumbers":["1"],"name":"The Daughter of Sherlock Holmes Mystery"}],"summary":"<p>From <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author Leonard Goldberg comes <i>The Daughter of Sherlock Holmes</i>, a new thrilling tale of the great detective\'s daughter and her companion, Dr. John Watson Jr., as they investigate a murder at the highest levels of British society. </p> <p>England, 1914. Joanna Blalock\'s keen mind and incredible insight lead her to become a highly skilled nurse, one of the few professions that allow her to use her finely tuned brain. But when she and her 10-year-old son witness a man fall to his death, apparently by suicide, they are visited by the elderly Dr. John Watson and his charming, handsome son, Dr. John Watson Jr. Impressed by her forensic skills, they invite her to become the third member of their investigative team. </p> <p>Caught up in a Holmesian mystery that spans from hidden treasure to the Second Afghan War of 1878-1880, Joanna and her companions must devise an ingenious plan to catch a murderer in the act while dodging familiar culprits, Scotland Yard, and members of the British aristocracy.
